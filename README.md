## Description
This is a natural language interface (chatbot) that
can answer basic geographical questions about Canada
& the US. The project is coded in Haskell, which made
IO and sentence parsing easy. The small dataset
used can be found in `Database.hs`, but as a bonus we
allowed users to modify answers and add their own
during the runtime of the program (i.e. these inputs
are not actually written to disk.).

## Getting Started
1. `ghci`
2. `:l main`
3. `start`

### Special Commands
- `db`: show the working dataset
- ``, `q`, `quit`: terminate the program
